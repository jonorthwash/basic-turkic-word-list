# basic-turkic-word-list
A basic Turkic word list for testing computational historical linguistics algorithms

## Limitations
* There's only one word given per sense
  * Sometimes the choice is arbitrary and forced as to which word is chosen
  * Often this approach hides the existence of cognates
* Sometimes cognates are favoured because of how dictionary was built.

## Sources
* Much of the basic wordlist was built from [StarLing's Turkic etymological database](http://starling.rinet.ru/cgi-bin/query.cgi?basename=\data\alt\turcet&root=config&morpho=0)
  * This has the occasional effect of favouring cognates
  * Transcriptions were adjusted based on JNW's [rudimentary] familiarity with some languages and to be more IPA-compatible
* The Kazakh and Kyrgyz data was drawn on JNW's own [L2/linguist] knowledge of the languages, and checked against dictionaries
* Other sources were consulted to clean up and expand coverage of individual languages.  These sources include:
  * Imart on Fu-yü Gyrgys
  * Clark (1998).  Turkmen Reference Grammar.
  * Баскаков et al. (1968).  Түкменче-русча сөзлүк.  [for Turkmen]
