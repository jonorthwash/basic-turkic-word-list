# basic-turkic-word-list
A basic Turkic word list for testing computational historical linguistics algorithms

## Limitations
* There's only one word given per sense
** Sometimes the choice is arbitrary and forced as to which word is chosen
** Often this approach hides the existence of cognates

## Sources
* Much of the basic wordlist was built from [StarLing's Turkic etymological database](http://starling.rinet.ru/cgi-bin/query.cgi?basename=\data\alt\turcet&root=config&morpho=0)
** This has the occasional effect of favouring cognates
** Transcriptions were adjusted based on JNW's [rudimentary] familiarity with some languages and to be more IPA-compatible
* The Kazakh and Kyrgyz data was drawn on JNW's own [L2/linguist] knowledge of the languages, and checked against dictionaries
